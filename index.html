                                for the
                                aurora borealis and the actual intensity of the aurora borealis in the North Pole. The
                                visualization demonstrates book-checkout data
                                from
                                the Seattle Public Library and the solar wind intensity data from NASA from 2006-2014.
                                The raw data sets were
                                processed through SQL and Python Jupyter Notebook and then visualized in a spherical
                                coordinate system to allow 4 dimensions of information (month, year, dewey class, and
                                level of interest/ intensity) to exist simultaneously. Users can scroll
                                through 10 years of data with the GUI element and see the
                                fluctuation between years animated. They can also turn on and off different
                                scales such as month, year, and dewey class with key press interaction. -->
                                Aurora is a three-dimensional data visualization and an immersive artwork (when viewed in virtual reality) that invites viewers to explore the dynamic relationship between human curiosity and the aurora borealis, a natural light display in the North Pole. Using a combination of book-checkout data from the Seattle Public Library and solar wind intensity data from NASA spanning from 2006-2014, Aurora visualizes four dimensions of information (month, year, book type, and level of interest/intensity) on a spherical coordinate system, allowing viewers to engage with the visualization from multiple perspectives. The raw data sets are transformed through SQL and Python and mapped to semi-transparent beams hovering over a sphere, creating wavering visuals resembling the northern light. By using the graphical user interface element, viewers can scroll through each year in the 10-year data set, observing the mesmerizing fluctuation between years, and even activating or deactivating various scales, such as month, year, and book type (dewey class). This innovative approach to data visualization invites viewers to explore the intersection of science and art, inspiring a new way of thinking about complex, multi-dimensional data sets, and providing a fresh perspective on the wonder of the aurora borealis.

                                Oscilla is an audio-visual installation that combines scientific and artistic representation while encouraging  experimentation and self-expression from the audience. Through a microphone, the audience can interact with a waveform presented in the style of signals shown on a typical oscilloscope. This interaction is enhanced by a ring-modulation filter, which provides a real-time audio feedback that encourages the audience to explore the boundaries of their own voices to produce visually and sonically complex results.
                                As the audience produces noise, pitch, or even harmonies, they will discover hidden patterns within the algorithm of the visual pattern, allowing them to gain control over the shape and movement of the waveform. The installation creates a space for self-discovery and introspection, as the audience experience the transformation of their own voice into a stunning visual representation.
                                Although an oscilloscope is typically associated with electrical engineering, it also serves as a medium for media artists to showcase the beauty inherent in signals. By interacting with Oscilla, the audience not only learns the principles of ring modulation in signal processing but also experiences the effect first hand. The work aims to evoke wonder in the audience as they discover a direct and tangible translation of meaning between the world of science and art.

                                Luminaria is an immersive LED installation, part of the IV Lightworks exhibition, that transforms a bridge in Anisquoio Park into a dynamic canvas of light and movement. The installation features an array of LED lights that respond to the incoming traffic, including pedestrians, bikes, and skateboards, detected by transducers attached underneath the bridge.
                                The installation is powered by four Arduino units that make it programmable, allowing for a range of different patterns and color schemes to be displayed in response to the movements of the passersby. The effect is mesmerizing, as the bridge becomes a living, breathing entity, illuminated by the colorful patterns and shapes that shift and change in response to the motion of the people passing by.
                                Through the use of technology and light, Luminaria invites viewers to contemplate the relationship between movement and art, while offering a unique and immersive experience that engages the senses and the mind. Visitors to the exhibition are encouraged to participate in the installation by walking, cycling, or skateboarding across the bridge, becoming part of the artwork itself and contributing to the dynamic display of light and movement.
                                Luminaria is a testament to the power of art to transform public spaces, and to the potential of technology to create immersive and interactive experiences that captivate and inspire.

                                GeoD is a powerful data visualization tool that sheds light on the relationship between named entities in topic models and their geographic context. By leveraging the Google Maps JS API, GeoD allows users to explore the locations mentioned in a topic model, from a global scale down to the street level. The tool also provides a way to analyze the relationship between the locales and the publishers related to a selected topic, revealing patterns in publishing activities and helping digital humanities researchers identify regional biases.

                                <br>
                                What sets GeoD apart is its ability to take raw output from an LDA model and utilize the Illinois Wikifier ( <a href=" L. Ratinov et al., 2011">L.Ratinov et al., 2011</a>) to confirm the recognition of named entities and eliminate duplications. By mapping the geographical information and publishers associated with each named entity, GeoD enables the analysis of locations discussed in the corpus underlying the model, revealing complex patterns and connections that are not readily apparent from traditional text-based analysis.

                                GeoD is a valuable addition to the <a href="https://www.gettoby.com/p/vs0whs15jsyt">Topic Model Observatory</a>, a <a href=“https://4humanities.org”>4 humanities</a> project funded by the <a href=“https://mellon.org/”>Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a> that aims to help researchers study public discourse about the humanities at large data scales. By revealing previously unseen insights into the geographic distribution of topics, GeoD helps researchers uncover new connections and patterns, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the data at hand. While the tool focuses primarily on journalistic articles available in digital textual form since 1981, its applications are far-reaching and can be utilized across a range of topics and contexts. Through our use of GeoD, we unlock a deeper understanding of the interconnectivity and complexity of the world we inhabit.

                                The<a href="https://www.mat.ucsb.edu/eoys2018/">MAT End of Year Show</a> is a curated exhibition featuring media art works and research demos from the Media Arts and Technology program. Each year we welcome hundreds of visitors from all around the world to celebrate a year of extraordinary work with us. Our theme this year is 'Invisible Machine', representing the mechanism of inducing transformation in the world of Media Arts. At MAT, our community research is the art of the “invisible becoming visible” in every field, from revealing the abstracted processes between input and output of a machine, to turning the complicated scientific data into shapes and colors. As technologists and artists, we weave through this diverse research in novel ways, creating new works that transcend the present way we view the world. Our show is the product of this process, and we invite all to join us in its celebration.

                                As the organizer of the show, I was thrilled to welcome visitors from all corners of the world to experience the extraordinary works of our talented artists and researchers and was immensely proud of the hard work and dedication that our artists and researchers put into their projects. I was also deeply moved by the way that visitors responded to the works on display. Whether they were experts in the field or simply curious members of the public, everyone who attended the show was captivated by the way art and technology change the way we see the world. The MAT End of Year Show was a testament to the immense potential for media artists to push the boundaries of human perception and creativity.
