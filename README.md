# Personal Website

## Main Function
Store projects I want to show. Projects include anything I've created that has a audio/visual aspect that I really like.

## Hidden Function
Some thoughts that I might want to share with people who really care. Page link is visually hidden on the main page. In dev tools, file name should be an alias like "contact.html" in order to hide from view.
